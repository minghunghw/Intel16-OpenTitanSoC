name         : Name of severity level. Must match severity defined in rules.
               Rules with "Fatal" severity CANNOT be waived. All others can be.

               severity (+r/-r switches)
cause_failure: yes: Lint status is "FAILED" if a rule with this severity is violated.
               no : Lint status is "PASSED" regardless of violation.

<severity name="Fatal" level="1" cause_failure="yes"/>
<severity name="Error" level="2" cause_failure="yes"/>
<severity name="Warning" level="3" cause_failure="no"/>
<severity name="Information" level="4" cause_failure="no"/>

<!--
Used to enable or disable rules or rule groups, and override parameters and severity levels.

The ordering of the items is important. Later items can enable/disable items
from above. A rule that was disabled higher up can be reenabled with a group
enable further down.

BKM: Enable/disable groups before rules.

E.g.:
<rule_group id="General" active="yes">
    <param type="string" name="modulesRegexp" value="*_.*_muc"/>
</rule_group>
<rule id="50000" active="yes" severity="Error">
<rule id="50001" active="no">
-->

<rule id="10001" active="yes" severity="Error">
    <param type="alphanumeric" name="ace_check_violations_xml" value="tools/build_audit/outputs/ace_check_violations.xml"/>
</rule>
<rule id="10002" active="yes" severity="Error"/>
<rule id="10003" active="yes" severity="Error"/>
