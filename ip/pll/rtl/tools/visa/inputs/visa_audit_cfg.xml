This following defines the severity levels.
name         : Name of severity level. Must match severity defined in rules.
               Rules with "Fatal" severity CANNOT be waived. All others can be.
level        : The level is used to allow the user to control rules to run based on severity (+r/-r switches)
cause_failure: "yes": Lint status is "FAILED" if a rule with this severity is violated.
               "no" : Lint status is "PASSED" regardless of violation.
